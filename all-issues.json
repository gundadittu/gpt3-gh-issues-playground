The collections in my UI Library in Studio still display properly in Studio, however, when I amplify pull the updated data models and UI components Locally I receive the following error:\r\n\r\n\u2716 Failed to sync the following components: ReviewCardCollection\r\n\r\nMy two data models are \"Products\" and \"Comments\", the relationship is: One Product to many Comments. It is the UI components/collections connected to Product which are failing on amplify pull.\r\n\r\n \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@aws-amplify/ui-react\": \"^4.2.1\",\r\n    \"@next/font\": \"13.0.7\",\r\n    \"aws-amplify\": \"^5.0.7\",\r\n    \"eslint\": \"8.30.0\",\r\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"13.0.7\",\r\n    \"next\": \"13.0.7\",\r\n    \"react\": \"18.2.0\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"18.2.0\"\r\n  }\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nReviewCardCollection to successfully pull down into my local environment  \n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Create 2 Data models with a one-to-many relationship in studio \r\n\r\n2. Bind Data to the Figma component in studio (bind Data to the model of the \"one\" end of the relationship, not \"many\") \r\n- For Example, My two data models are \"Products\" and \"Comments\", the relationship is: One Product to many Comments. It is the UI components/collections connected to Product which are failing on amplify pull.\r\n\r\n3. run Amplify pull \n\n### Project Identifier\n\nProject Identifier: 8256d957cdb678368dd17119602bff91\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_", "comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/comments/1360423499", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/763#issuecomment-1360423499", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/763", "id": 1360423499, "node_id": "IC_kwDOEt5APc5RFmpL", "user": {"login": "Ed-Marcavage", "id": 61299527, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYxMjk5NTI3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61299527?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage", "html_url": "https://github.com/Ed-Marcavage", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ed-Marcavage/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2022-12-20T23:01:59Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-20T23:07:54Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Yes I am able to preview the collection in Studio when I configured this collection.

However, when i use the generated React component, I get [object Object] instead of the JSON.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe text area field in the generated update form should show the JSON string and not [object Object].\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Create a data model with AWSJSON fields\r\n2. Create a Form Builder update form from the data model\r\n3. Add the generate form component to a React page, and load it with a previously created record that contains valid JSON in the fields\r\n4. The form will load with [object Object] in the text area field\n\n### Project Identifier\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nLooking at the generated React component, the issue appears to be the `resetStateValues` function. The individual useState hooks for each JSON field set their initial values with a JSON.stringify - e.g.\r\n`const [bodyConfig, setBodyConfig] = React.useState(\r\n    initialValues.bodyConfig\r\n      ? JSON.stringify(initialValues.bodyConfig)\r\n      : undefined\r\n  );`\r\nThis doesn't seem to be used though, `initialValues` is a const that just has undefined values for each field. The actual values from the record that is retrieved are set via the useEffect hook which runs resetStateValues, and this function doesn't include a JSON.stringify when it sets the values, e.g.\r\n`setBodyConfig(cleanValues.bodyConfig);`\r\n\r\nIf i change it manually to add that in myself, the form works:\r\n`setBodyConfig(JSON.stringify(cleanValues.bodyConfig));`\r\n\r\n", "comments": []}, {"number": "748", "body": "### Which Specific Feature is your question related to?\n\ntest-github-webhook\n\n### Question\n\ntest-github-webhook", "comments": []}, {"number": "747", "body": "### Which Specific Feature is your question related to?\n\ntest-github-hook\n\n### Question\n\ntest-github-hook", "comments": []}, {"number": "746", "body": "### Before opening, please confirm:\n\n\n- [X] I have [searched for duplicate or closed issues](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-adminui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+).\n- [X] I have read the guide for [submitting bug reports](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-adminui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports).\n- [X] I have done my best to include a minimal, self-contained set of instructions for consistently reproducing the issue.\n- [X] I have removed any sensitive information from my code snippets and submission.\n\n### App Id\n\nNA\n\n### Region\n\nNA\n\n### Environment name\n\nNA\n\n### Figma File Version (if applicable)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Amplify CLI Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### If applicable, what version of Node.js are you using?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser type?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nTest\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNA\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\nNA\n\n### Project Identifier\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nTest", "comments": []}, {"number": "739", "body": "\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-adminui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Description of changes\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your Pull Request!

The last big thing I did was to re-create my environments cause they enter in a fatal state https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-category-api/issues/819#issuecomment-1268034381 then as I wanted to seed data there I enter to amplify studio and realize it is not showing anything for any of my environments. Facts:\r\n\r\n- Amplify Studio is not displaying the content management for any env\r\n- There is nothing on the dev console that guide me throughout something wrong _(as often happens with sync issues)_\r\n- Amplify Studio used to be working before\r\n- I can't ensure that the re-creation of the env is the event that broke the behavior as the last time I use it was to see my local env _(weeks before the re-creation of the envs)_\r\n- AppSync console is working perfectly fine _(probably it's what I'll need to use in the mean time)_\r\n- The application is working fine on the browser and backend\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI should be able to open Amplify Studio and see the content management UI as it used to be there.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction steps\r\n\r\nAs I stand before, I am not sure how I arrived to this point.

This follows Node.js 12 End-Of-Life (EOL) reached on April 30, 2022 [1].\r\n\r\nAs described in the Lambda runtime support policy [2], end of support for language runtimes in Lambda happens in two stages. Starting November 14, 2022, Lambda will no longer apply security patches and other updates to the Node.js 12 runtime used by Lambda functions, and functions using Node.js 12 will no longer be eligible for technical support. In addition, you will no longer be able to create new Lambda functions using the Node.js 12 runtime. Starting December 14, 2022, you will no longer be able to update existing functions using the Node.js 12 runtime.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you upgrade your existing Node.js 12 functions to Node.js 16 before November 14, 2022.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAmplify studio creates the following functions with Node.js 12 runtime.\r\n\r\n\tamplify-login-verify-auth-challenge\r\n        amplify-login-define-auth-challenge\r\n\tamplify-login-custom-message\r\n        amplify-login-create-auth-challenge\r\n\r\nThere are two issues here.\r\n\r\n1. Amplify studio should generate Node.js 14.x or Node.js 16.x runtime Lambda functions.\r\n2. Also, What are the best steps to migrate already existing functions to Node.js 14 or Node.js 16 runtime ? In case toggling it off and on is the only option, what if I have many users in my Cognito \"amplify-backend-manager\" user pool ?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAmplify studio should create Node.js 14.x or Node.js 16.x runtime Lambda functions.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. If you have enabled Amplify studio in the past, check the Lambda function with name mentioned above.\r\n2. If not, try enabling Amplify studio and wait for it to create Lambda function with Node.js 12 runtime.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_", "comments": []}, {"number": "636", "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem?

the bug\n\nAuth does not set custom headers when I authenticate user\r\n\r\nI am using vue and nuxtjs to build a static website\r\n\r\nI authenticate the user using the following code: \r\n\r\n`async SignIn({ commit }, payload) {\r\n        try {\r\n            const user = await Auth.signIn(payload.EmailPhone, payload.Password);\r\n            payload.username = user.challengeParam.userAttributes.name\r\n            payload.user = user.username\r\n            console.log(user.getSession())\r\n            commit(\"SignInMutate\", payload)\r\n        } catch (error) {\r\n            console.log('error signing in', error);\r\n        }\r\n    },`\r\n\r\nWhich works i.e. I get an object returned such as the following:\r\n\r\n`CognitoUser {username: 'T', pool: CognitoUserPool, Session: 'X', client: Client, signInUserSession: null, \u2026}\r\nSession: X\r\nauthenticationFlowType: \"USER_SRP_AUTH\"\r\nchallengeName: \"NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED\"\r\nchallengeParam: {userAttributes: {\u2026}, requiredAttributes: Array(1)}\r\nclient: Client {endpoint: 'https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/', fetchOptions: {\u2026}}\r\nkeyPrefix: \"CognitoIdentityServiceProvider.Y\"\r\npool: CognitoUserPool {userPoolId: 'X', clientId: 'X', client: Client, advancedSecurityDataCollectionFlag: true, storage: Storage, \u2026}\r\nsignInUserSession: null\r\nstorage: Storage {length: 0}\r\nuserDataKey: \"F\"\r\nusername: \"Y\"\r\n[[Prototype]]: Object`\r\n\r\nHowever when I then make api calls to my datastore or try to get the authenticated user I get errors stating that the current user is not authenticated.\r\n \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nUser gets custom header with JWT token included and this can run api calls which require authentication\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\nauthenticate a user in my pool.\r\nthen make an api call that requires an authenticated user.\n\n### Additional information\n\nhere is

Here's what I'm trying to do when I came across that error:\r\n\r\nAfter I sync UI library with Figma, I configure my UI component by selecting the button and coming to the \"child properties\" at the right of Amplify Studio to set the following properties:\r\n\r\n- Prop: onClick\r\n- Action: Create new\r\n- Model: VehicleProfile (just the name of my own data model used in my project)\r\n\r\nThen under Model field names, I populate the fields by matching text fields on UI to Model field. The error occurs while I match one of the text fields on UI to data model fields. I would noticed the preview of the component gone with message \"SyntaxError: No-Inline evaluations must call `render`\" came up in place.\r\n\r\nOnce this error pops up, Amplify studio is unable to render the UI component again. The only way out of this error, is to delete the component from UI library, then make some change in Figma and re-sync. However, it was pretty consistent that when I repeat the steps above again, the error will come back.\r\n\r\nI suspected it was either a field in my data model or a text field in the Figma design that offended the component rendering process in Amplify Studio. I mocked around the data model fields and text fields, and came to realized that it was one of the fields in my data model, being named \"model\". \r\n\r\nSince my data model is about vehicle and one of its fields \"model\" might be a reserved word. I can't say that's the cause of the original complaint above but for better developer experience I'd be preferred to be told about reserved words to avoid as field name.\r\n\r\nNow I used capitalized word \"Model\" as the field name in my data model and have not ran into the error again.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"703\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50001769/194370905-979b7f0f-b566-455d-a279-b75dc1269db6.png\">\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/comments/1270392979/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "performed_via_github_app": null, "issue_id": "551"}]}, {"number": "550", "body": "i  have already have a full functioning PWA app (index.html,javascript,sw.js,manifest,etc). how do move my exsiting files into and use amplily to do this.\r\n\r\nps sorry for my typing. i am handicaped. i am familure with AWS.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\nbradley", "comments": []}, {"number": "549", "body": "### Before opening, please confirm:\r\n\r\n\r\n- [X] I have [searched for duplicate or closed issues](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-adminui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+).\r\n- [X] I have read the guide for [submitting bug reports](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-adminui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports).\r\n- [X] I have done my best to include a minimal, self-contained set of instructions for consistently reproducing the issue.\r\n\r\n### App Id\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Region\r\n\r\nus-east-2\r\n\r\n### Environment name\r\n\r\ndev\r\n\r\n### Amplify CLI Version\r\n\r\n8.1.0\r\n\r\n### If applicable, what version of Node.js are you using?\r\n\r\n14.16.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Browser type?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI tries to deploy it but the Frontend builds getting failed.\r\nErrors say that \"Cannot find module 'acorn'\".\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49632136/169645515-dc894d54-4672-4b8d-b986-9c468674e17e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49632136/169645524-888e63f7-ac66-4249-ba78-fcfd5fe617d9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBuild should be published successfully.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction steps\r\n\r\n1.

So far I followed your reproduce steps by doing:\r\n> \r\n> * Duplicated the UI Kit, created my component, sync, added bindings, sync\r\n> * Duplicated the UI Kit, created my component, sync, added bindings, created another component in Figma, sync\r\n> \r\n> Both scenarios did not produce the issue. In order for me to reproduce the issue, I will need more information from you. Since you are not permitted to share the Figma file with us due to access policy, here are some things that you can do:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Isolate the issue on a specific component\r\n> 2. Duplicate the UI Kit, create a similar component with the same primitives (please make it look different from your team's). Give this new Figma file a different name from your team's Figma file.\r\n> 3. Sync this file (don't worry it won't override your components as long as you give it a different name).\r\n> 4. List which primitives have bindings and which do not.\r\n> 5. Send this new Figma file and the list to [kpranoto@amazon.com](mailto:kpranoto@amazon.com), please set the subject to 'Github Issue [Sync with Figma going into infinite-state\u00a0#523](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-adminui/issues/523)'\r\n> \r\n> Without the information above, our team won't be able to reproduce the issue and we won't be able to provide the help that your team needs.\r\n\r\n@kpranoto-aws  how are you today?

The environment appears in my Amplify console `backend environments` list but it has no enabled categories, and is empty if I click into the studio.\r\n\r\nI have also tried to clone using `amplify env add` then `amplify push` which creates a similar issue. That gives a more detailed error:\r\n\r\n```ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/Users/<myname>/Projects/<dirName>/<projectName>/amplify/#current-cloud-backend/api/appapi'.\r\nError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/Users/<myname>/Projects/<dirName>/<projectName>/amplify/#current-cloud-backend/auth/userPoolGroups'\r\n\u2716 An error occurred when pushing the resources to the cloud\r\n\ud83d\uded1 An error occurred during the push operation: Unable to upload trigger files to S3\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried manually adding those files and it did not work.

You CAN however add such a URL just fine via Amplify CLI.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nValidation behaviour between the Amplify Studio interface and the Amplify CLI should be identical. Both should easily allow you to add URIs that use custom protocols.\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. In Amplify Studio, visit the \"Authentication\" Section\r\n2. Add an Oauth login mechanism (Google for example).\r\n3. In the \"Sign-in & sign-out redirect URLs\", try entering a URL with a non-HTTP protocol (e.g. `myapp://login/`)\r\n4. You will receive this frontend validation error: `Must use https:// or http://localhost or {app_url}://`\r\n5.

I wasn't sure if `{app_url}` was some sort of environment variable I had to set somewhere else. It took me a while to realise `{app_url}` was just meant to indicate you could freely enter a custom protocol.\r\n\r\nIdeally, if this bug were fixed, the validation messaging could also be refined to potentially be more explicit in saying, hey, feel free to use any custom protocol here.", "comments": []}, {"number": "478", "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem?

Create Model named AAA\r\n2. Create Model named BBB\r\n3. Create an relationship between the two. (let's say one-to-many)\r\n4. Create a new Model and start to write its name AAA (which will raise a \"duplicate name\" error) than add another letter to the name, lets say \"B\" (so we will have a new name AAAB).\r\n5. This will create a duplicate relationship between AAA and BBB\r\n\r\n* You can repeat step 4, and it will recreate duplicate relationships\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nAdditionally, but not so related to this bug - \r\nWhen you create a connection (relationship) from model A to model B - the name of the connection in model A will start with an uppercase letter, but the connection name in model B will start with a lowercase letter - it's a bit annoying :)", "comments": []}, {"number": "470", "body": "**Which Specific Feature is your question related to?** Amplify Studio Content\r\n\r\nIs there a way to change what is used in the autocomplete for referenced items?

Go to \"Data\" on the left-hand window of the Amplify UI to adjust the data model for the particular AWS Amplify backend app.\r\n2. Adjust the data model and select \"Save and deploy\".\r\n3. This should trigger the bug.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_", "comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/comments/1005800133", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/428#issuecomment-1005800133", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/428", "id": 1005800133, "node_id": "IC_kwDOEt5APc4780rF", "user": {"login": "tizuemg", "id": 7280187, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyODAxODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7280187?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg", "html_url": "https://github.com/tizuemg", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tizuemg/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2022-01-05T15:25:31Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-05T15:25:31Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Same here, appID `dqxz9invx10sl` in `us-east-1`, `dev` environment, but pushed/deployed model changes with the CLI (7.6.5).

I am trying to build a project from scratch and for this, I am using this guide:\r\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/build-newsfeed-with-aws-amplify-studio/\r\n\r\nI have created my data model, my UI element, pulled everything locally, etc. but:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24582195/147301258-3f1c9a48-78ae-40ec-b1b6-0234802079ef.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24582195/147301278-f35deabe-bde2-471d-b8df-c89cb04aed07.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24582195/147301299-1e4b27ba-bcaa-422c-b75b-6d426736c799.png)\r\n\r\n- When I display one single element, the element appears but no data is present\r\n- When I display a collection of element, nothing appears. Worse, I don't see any API call being made to query the data in the Network console of my web browser.\r\n\r\nThen I did try to \"force\" getting my data with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport './App.css';\r\nimport { CardA, BBQProfile, BBQProfileCollection } from './ui-components';\r\n\r\nimport React, { useEffect } from \"react\";\r\nimport { DataStore } from '@aws-amplify/datastore';\r\nimport { Cook } from './models';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  async function query() {\r\n    console.log(\"query\");\r\n    const models = await DataStore.query(Cook);\r\n    console.log(models);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    query()\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"App\">\r\n      Here !\r\n      <input type=\"button\" onClick={query} />\r\n      <BBQProfile />\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut no API call either.. and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nI am trying to understand... By following the guide, it seems that it kind of works without having to do anything particular... But I can't get it to work.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?? It's fresh new install, new project, new everything.\r\n\r\nThanks", "comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/comments/1002869389", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/418#issuecomment-1002869389", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/418", "id": 1002869389, "node_id": "IC_kwDOEt5APc47xpKN", "user": {"login": "philippegabert", "id": 24582195, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTgyMTk1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24582195?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert", "html_url": "https://github.com/philippegabert", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philippegabert/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2021-12-30T04:31:40Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-30T04:31:40Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Hi @scottyoung, \r\n\r\nI have restarted pretty much from scratch but still not success...

So, I started pushing four types at a time.  Eventually, it got to where I was getting stuck with single, small types.\r\n\r\nAlso, I learned to watch the stacks from the CodeFormation UI, while pushing from the CLI or while using the Studio UI, and that some stacks need to be re-rolled back from the CF UI.\r\n\r\nOn my last type, it could only push the ID field.  So, I gave up to try to Studio UI.  Then, it got stuck.  CF isn't showing any rollback issues, and I was able to push the prior schema from the terminal, without an issue.\r\n\r\nYet, the Studio UI is stuck in deployment status and claiming that a rollback that I reportedly initiated is stuck.\r\n \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTo be able to return to a standard Amplify Studio screen....\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\nToo much to reproduce....\n\n### Additional information\n\nNone\r\n\r\nThanks", "comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/comments/999119102", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/412#issuecomment-999119102", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/412", "id": 999119102, "node_id": "IC_kwDOEt5APc47jVj-", "user": {"login": "clarkfwhite", "id": 67336725, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY3MzM2NzI1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67336725?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite", "html_url": "https://github.com/clarkfwhite", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarkfwhite/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2021-12-21T21:55:11Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-22T04:33:49Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "@busster , \n\nAnnnnnnd, it's doing it, again.\r\n\r\nJust like the last time, the Amplify's Deployment Status screen isn't matching with what CFN is telling me.

the initial model via `@hasOne` or `@hasMany` with DataStore enabled.\r\n> \r\n> To mitigate an issue with an unsupported DataStore graphQL schema using the `@hasOne` or `hasMany` directive pointing to a model that refers back to itself with either `@hasOne` or `@hasMany`, please execute the following steps.\r\n> \r\n> 1. Pull your project locally with model generation disabled by running `amplify pull --appId {appid} --envName {envname} --no-codegen` where {appid} is your app id and {envname} is your backend environment name\r\n> 2. Update your `schema.graphql` file, and ensure that no models circularly reference each other via `@hasOne` and `@hasMany`. You can update `@hasOne` to `@belongsTo` as shown below.\r\n> 3. Push back to cloud with `amplify push`\r\n> 4. After `amplify push` completes, refresh the Amplify Studio page before deploying again.\r\n> \r\n> ## Unsupported DataStore Schema Example\r\n> ```graphql\r\n> type Blog @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {\r\n>     id: ID!\r\n>     posts: [Post] @hasMany(indexName: \"byBlog\", fields: [\"id\"])\r\n> }\r\n> type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {\r\n>     id: ID!\r\n>     blog: Blog @hasOne\r\n>     postID: ID @index(name: \"byBlog\")\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ## Supported DataStore Schema Example\r\n> ```graphql\r\n> type Blog @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {\r\n>     id: ID!\r\n>     posts: [Post] @hasMany(indexName: \"byBlog\", fields: [\"id\"])\r\n> }\r\n> type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {\r\n>     id: ID!\r\n>     blog: Blog @belongsTo\r\n>     postID: ID @index(name: \"byBlog\")\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nThis didnt work, after step 1 completed, the amplify folder does not even have a backend folder with the schema.graphql file. It just has one folder.\r\n![SharedScreenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70818877/145694529-0ce2c160-ae7e-46dd-9875-00b1432241be.jpg)\r\nTherefore, I am unable to even see if steps 2-4

This has been happening because I have disabled subscriptions on lots of my models in my schema. I have added `(subscriptions: null)` in order to avoid automatic subscriptions, this is because I currently have 37 models/tables and I have reached the max 100 subscriptions warning if I don't do this (I'm actually waiting also for the feature you guys mentioned you are working on, regarding the ability to subscribe or unsubscribe models on-demand without having issues) and if you do the math 37 * 3 = 111 subscriptions is more  than the current limit. So by adding this (subscriptions: null) property I'm getting this warning on Admin UI: \r\n`[WARN] 01:48.780 DataStore - subscriptionError Connection failed: {\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Validation error of type FieldUndefined: Field 'onCreateCustomer' in type 'Subscription' is undefined @ 'onCreateCustomer'\"}]}`\r\nAnd I get a lot more like this one, I believe that this is for the models that I added the subscriptions: null property. I have tested that if I remove the subscriptions: null and let the models subscribe as normal the Admin UI works perfectly and shows my data, but the downside of this is that on my front end (a mobile app) I get the max subscriptions warning and I start to have odd behaviors in some update processes.\r\n<img width=\"1454\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-01 at 10 04 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3430951/144282525-15fc97dd-1b24-442c-b1a2-5749d029c37e.png\">\r\n \r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would like to see my data content displayed on the Admin UI even if I disable subscriptions on my models, or have a way that I could unsubscribe on-demand certain models and not get this kind of warnings on the Admin UI. \n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Add `(subscriptions: null)` to models on my schema.\r\n2. Do `amplify push`\r\n3. Open Admin UI \r\n4.

It seems silly to execute a fetch query and then a mutation every time we want to overwrite data. \r\n\r\nIf there is no better way and it is recommended to run a fetch first to grab the _version of the object, then why does my fetch result in the error message:     `\"Cannot return null for non-nullable type: 'Int' within parent '<query name> ' (/<query name>/_version)\"`?\r\n\r\nBy the way, because I ran into this error, I ran two update mutations consecutively as a workaround, pulling the version number from the response of the first update mutation (which as expected does not overwrite data), and using this version number in the second update mutation (which then succeeds in overwriting the data). This seems like bad practice and is surely not recommended.\r\n", "comments": []}, {"number": "268", "body": "**Which Specific Feature is your question related to?**\r\nNotifications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Provide additional details e.g. code snippets**\r\nHi, I'm trying to add push notifications to a flutter app. I see that notifications are part of javascript and other languages, but I don't see documentation for it for flutter.

Please provide your console log and other details here.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the console, I can see the following errors:\r\n```\r\nDataStore - subscriptionError Connection failed: {\"errors\":[{\"errorType\":\"Unauthorized\",\"message\":\"Not Authorized to access onDelete<MODEL> on type Subscription\"}]}\r\n\r\nDataStore - subscriptionError Connection failed: {\"errors\":[{\"errorType\":\"Unauthorized\",\"message\":\"Not Authorized to access onUpdate<MODEL> on type Subscription\"}]}\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the first model syncs without any issue, logging `appsync modelSynced` but then times out afterwards. Only one of my models has an `@auth` directive, which is the only one which appears to sync according to this log and when inspecting GraphQL responses. Other models fail with the following error:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n        \"sync<MODEL>\": null\r\n    },\r\n    \"errors\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"path\": [\r\n                \"sync<MODEL>\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"data\": null,\r\n            \"errorType\": \"Unauthorized\",\r\n            \"errorInfo\": null,\r\n            \"locations\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"line\": 2,\r\n                    \"column\": 3,\r\n                    \"sourceName\": null\r\n                }\r\n            ],\r\n            \"message\": \"Not Authorized to access sync<MODEL> on type Query\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the UI to load on the Content page without errors.\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Run `amplify push`\r\n2. Navigate to the Content page, which prompts you to go to the Data page and \"Save and Deploy\"\r\n3. After \"Save and Deploy\" has finished, navigate back to the Content page\r\n4.

Create data models using the Data tab in AdminUI, including an 'Information' data model with 4 fields. Save & deploy. (Note: no records exist)\r\n2. Rename a field, getting prompted that all data would be cleared -> proceed. \r\n#### In the below steps, I'm trying to make a circular reference which I now understand is disappointingly a restriction of the AdminUI :(\r\n3. Add a 1:1 relationship to another model. Rename the created field to be 'informationID'.\r\n4. Delete the relationship, including the 'informationID' field.\r\n5. Add a field in the 'Information' model called 'informationID' with datatype [ID].\r\n6. Save & deploy. Content tab works, but no circular reference.\r\n8. In DynamoDB, manually create an index in the exact same format as the other tables: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18284908/123184878-fba6c580-d4d7-11eb-918c-5a63b836c01f.png)\r\n9. Go back to Content tab: refresh; not loading (same error state => no errors)\r\n10. Back to DynamoDB: delete newly created Index.\r\n11. Content tab: refresh; still not loading.\r\n12. Delete entire Information model.\r\n13. Content tab: refresh; still not loading. \r\n14. (GraphQL queries still return good data for the rest of the models)\r\n15. ### Fix: Do all edits in Edge\r\n\r\n(In all times, I made no manual changes to the schema, apart from in the Data tab)\r\n\r\n## Before\r\nAs I said above, this happened to me the other week. So, I\u2019ll try and remember as best as I can:\r\n1. Once again, have the data models set up. The table is called \u2018Content\u2019\r\n  - One m:1 relationship (one Content to many)\r\n  - ~12 existing records\r\n2. In the Data tab, create a new field. Save & deploy.\r\n3. In the DynamoDB, because it was faster, I added in the missing fields in the existing records\r\n4. Go back to Content tab: refresh; same problem. Continuously loading, same error state, no errors.\r\n5. after a few days, and possibly one or two deploys later, it seemed to resolve itself temporarily, for one session and then back to the same Loading state again.\r\n6. ### Fix:\r\n  - The last time, I tried to fix it by undoing adding the new field, which didn\u2019t fix the issue\r\n  - In the end, after either removing all of the records in the table or removing all of the models and redeploying, the issue was resolved. (I can\u2019t remember which was the solution)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n## Network Activity\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18284908/123186254-1dee1280-d4db-11eb-880e-1f68ffdc27f1.png)\r\n\r\n## What I haven't tried\r\n- Adding back the model in question to see if it has any effect\r\n- Minimal reproduction: \r\n  - See *what* changes cause this to break, adding indices (indexes), changing records, etc.\r\n  - Find exact reproduction steps for this issue\r\n\r\n## Thoughts\r\nI really don't know much about Amplify nor the AdminUI, so maybe what I'm doing here is completely silly. I understand if touching the DB isn't a valid use-case, but if some change causes the AdminUI to fail silently, it's still probably a bug. \r\nI'd like to see what is causing the issue and a potential non-damaging fix could be.\r\n\r\n<sup>This is my first GitHub issue, so please let me know if I'm doing something wrong!</sup>\r\n\r\n## Potentially related Issue:\r\n#159 (closed)\r\n\r\n# Postscript\r\nAfter returning to get screenshots of the console (Chrome), it seems that there error messages in the dev-pane console, not sure if they are relevent:\r\n<img width=\"682\" alt=\"adminUIconsole\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18284908/123185804-15e1a300-d4da-11eb-89ae-90e25c496f27.PNG\">\r\n<img width=\"679\" alt=\"adminUIconsole2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18284908/123185807-1712d000-d4da-11eb-9269-876481a57820.PNG\">\r\n<img width=\"205\" alt=\"adminUIconsole3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18284908/123185809-17ab6680-d4da-11eb-8019-d087f196a3a0.PNG\">\r\n\r\n", "comments": []}, {"number": "245", "body": "### Before opening, please confirm:\r\n\r\n\r\n- [X] I have [searched for duplicate or closed issues](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) and [discussions](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/discussions).\r\n- [X] I have read the guide for [submitting bug reports](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports).\r\n- [X] I have done my best to include a minimal, self-contained set of instructions for consistently reproducing the issue.\r\n\r\n### JavaScript Framework\r\n\r\nNext.js\r\n\r\n### Amplify APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication, Analytics, REST API, GraphQL API, Storage\r\n\r\n### Amplify Categories\r\n\r\nauth, storage, function, api, analytics\r\n\r\n### Environment information\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Put output below this line\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.19 Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (Focal Fossa)\r\n    CPU: (5) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700KF CPU @ 3.60GHz\r\n    Memory: 1.84 GB / 3.84 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.8 - /usr/bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 12.18.3 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v12.18.3/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.18.0 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.14.6 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v12.18.3/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @babel/core: 7.12.10 => 7.12.10 (7.14.5)\r\n    @testing-library/dom: 7.28.1 => 7.28.1 (7.31.2)\r\n    @testing-library/jest-dom: 5.11.6 => 5.11.6 \r\n    @testing-library/react: 11.2.1 => 11.2.1 \r\n    @testing-library/user-event: 12.3.0 => 12.3.0 \r\n    @types/node: 14.14.20 => 14.14.20 (15.12.2, 14.17.3)\r\n    @types/react: 17.0.0 => 17.0.0 (17.0.11)\r\n    babel-jest: 26.6.3 => 26.6.3 \r\n    babel-loader: 8.2.2 => 8.2.2 \r\n    cz-conventional-changelog: 3.3.0 => 3.3.0 (3.2.0)\r\n    jest: 26.6.3 => 26.6.3 \r\n    jest-sonar-reporter: 2.0.0 => 2.0.0 \r\n    typescript: 4.0.5 => 4.0.5 (3.9.9)\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    @aws-amplify/cli: 4.50.2\r\n    bit-bin: 14.8.8\r\n    create-react-app: 4.0.3\r\n    depcheck: 1.2.0\r\n    jest: 26.6.3\r\n    lerna: 3.22.1\r\n    locize-cli: 7.6.6\r\n    now: 20.1.1\r\n    npm: 6.14.6\r\n    prerendercloud-server: 0.5.0\r\n    roast: 2.3.17\r\n    serverless: 2.10.0\r\n    source-map-explorer: 2.5.0\r\n    vercel: 20.1.1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI tried to create a new env with `amplify env add`, choose \"prod\" as new env's name and Amplify Admin UI for authentication method.

Please provide your console log and other details here.**\"\r\n\r\nThe GraphQL schema was created using CLI and pushed using \"amplify push\". Once pushed, I was able to also \"save and deploy\" using the Admin UI console. \r\n\r\nAfter successfully being able to \"save and deploy\", I was able to use the content manager to create a parent entity (example: StoreLocation) and create one child entity (StoreAddress) and add the child entity to the parent entity. \r\n\r\nAfter creating these two related entities, I was no longer able to access the console. \r\n\r\nIt seems to time out while trying to load the screen. I am able to sync with the data from my local amplify application. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect to be able to continue to use the Admin UI's content manager after initial creation of relational entities. \n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Create Graph QL relational schema with authentication settings and generate models.\r\n2. Push to amplify (amplify push) to deploy schema\r\n3. Login to amplify UI and perform a \"save and deploy\" on your data model, in order to use content manager\r\n4. Add content using content manager, where there is at least one parent with a child entity associated to it. \r\n5. Update schema by removing all authentication restrictions (@auth) and re-publish from CLI\r\n6. Log into amplify UI and perform a \"save and deploy\" on your data model. \r\n7. Access content manager again and see error message. \n\n### Additional information\n\nChrome console log: \r\n\r\n[us-east-x.admin.amplifyapp.com-1622125936856.log](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-adminui/files/6554857/us-east-x.admin.amplifyapp.com-1622125936856.log)\r\n", "comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/comments/880718911", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/219#issuecomment-880718911", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/219", "id": 880718911, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDcxODkxMQ==", "user": {"login": "henok", "id": 498375, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODM3NQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498375?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok", "html_url": "https://github.com/henok", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henok/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2021-07-15T14:00:29Z", "updated_at": "2021-07-15T14:02:24Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Sorry for the late response, I have since added back the auth directive to: \r\n\r\n- Allow any signed-in cognito user to perform CRUD on all owned entities\r\n- Allow any signed-in cognito user to perform reads on all entities\r\n- Allow API key access to perform CRUD on all entities\r\n\r\nScreen shots from UI: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/498375/125800342-7b760868-724b-484c-825c-4918a8926db1.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/498375/125800397-ede2d1ea-c8ae-482b-aaed-1a4aca71cecd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI am able to see the content screen now on the amplify console, however the new data model is not being deployed.

My expected behavior form user is to confirm email by clicking the link in the email received by him.

I had to enable pop-ups for the window to open. Though the documentation, to me, seems clear that it should automatically log me in using my AWS account for the first time.\r\nhttps://docs.amplify.aws/console/adminui/start\r\nThe issue also appears when using the amplify CLI and running the `amplify pull --appId randomNumsLetters --envName staging` command from the Terminal. The webpage opens, but does not automatically log me in.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI should be able to log in to the Admin UI and access the backend services for my new app. My project's name is Connecting-The-Beads. Does AWS Admin UI not like dashes or capital letters?\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIt shows this message for a fraction of a second.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1236\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64751759/108222139-203ffa80-70fe-11eb-888f-1d52b9e5a675.png\">\r\n\r\n**Amplify CLI Version (if issue tied to Amplify CLI) **\r\n - CLI Version: 4.43.0\r\n - OS: macOS 10.14\r\n - Node Version. 12.18.4\r\n - Browser type: Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox Developer's Edition\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIf I'm missing something obvious in the set up process, please let me know.

One I push that, my Admin UI breaks, and throws the following in the console:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-24 at 11 57 55 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7662191/115969952-65185100-a4f4-11eb-93bd-dc3a2ed703d7.png\">\r\n\r\nAt this point, the entire admin UI is broken, and I see the following in my terminal when I push the video category changes as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUPDATE_COMPLETE apikomitas                     AWS::CloudFormation::Stack Sat Apr 24 2021 11:48:09 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)\r\nUPDATE_COMPLETE authgatekeepr                  AWS::CloudFormation::Stack Sat Apr 24 2021 11:48:10 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)\r\nUPDATE_COMPLETE amplify-komitas-staging-112055 AWS::CloudFormation::Stack Sat Apr 24 2021 11:48:10 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)\r\nFailed to create models in the cloud: Modelgen job creation failed\r\n\u2714 All resources are updated in the cloud\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoesn't tell me why the modelgen job failed, doesn't provide a trace.
